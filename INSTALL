To install libtap on a unix-like system:

    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

On Windows, the library can be created by first setting up
the correct development environment variables. Usually this
is done by running vcvars32.bat included in the visual studio
distribution. You should also install gnu make which can be
found at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm.
Also, you should have perl to run the tests although this isnt
absolutely necessary. Once this is done, you should be able to
run the following:

    > make GNU=
    > make check

You can also might want to make use of the visual studio project file
included.

It may not be necessary to install it on your system. You can copy tap.c
and tap.h into your project and it should have no problem compiling.

    $ ls
    tap.c tap.h test.c
    $ cat test.c
    #include "tap.h"
    int main () {
        plan(1);
        ok(50 + 5, "foo %s", "bar");
        done_testing;
    }
    $ gcc test.c tap.c
    $ a.out
    1..1
    ok 1 - foo bar
